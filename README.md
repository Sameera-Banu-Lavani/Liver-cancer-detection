# Classification Using CNN with XGBOOST in Liver Cancer Detection       

This project aims to assist in early detection of brain tumors using CT scan images. We’ve combined the strength of deep learning (CNN) and the power of XGBoost to build a smart, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostic tool—all deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

## What This Project Does
Takes a CT scan image as input.
Analyzes it using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Uses XGBoost to classify the image.
Outputs a clear result:
  “Tumor Detected” or “No Tumor Detected”

## Technologies Used
Python + Google Colab – Development environment with GPU support
TensorFlow/Keras – For CNN-based image feature extraction
XGBoost – High-performance gradient boosting classifier
Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib – Data analysis & visualization
Streamlit – Interactive web interface
ngrok – Secure public link to the local app
